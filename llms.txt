**Transport Modeling:** Network Processing, Route Enumeration, and
Traffic Assignment with Path-Sized Logit

`flownet` provides efficient tools for transportation modeling in R,
supporting network processing, route enumeration, and traffic assignment
tasks. It implements the path-sized logit (PSL) model for traffic
assignment and provides powerful utilities for network
processing/preparation.

### Key Features

- **Path-Sized Logit Model**: Stochastic traffic assignment accounting
  for route overlap
- **Network Processing**: Convert LINESTRING geometries to graphs,
  consolidate graphs, and simplify networks
- **Route Enumeration**: Efficient algorithm for finding alternative
  routes between origin-destination pairs
- **High Performance**: [fastverse](https://fastverse.org/fastverse/)
  packages and custom C implementations for critical path operations
- **Multithreading**: Asynchronous parallelism using `mirai` for faster
  processing of large networks

## Quick Start

Below I provide some boilerplate code. See also the [introductory
vignette](https://sebkrantz.github.io/flownet/articles/introduction.html)
for richer examples.

### Basic Usage

``` r
library(flownet)

# Create a small graph data frame
graph <- data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 2, 3),
                    to = c(2, 3, 4, 4), cost = c(5, 3, 2, 4))

# Prepare OD matrix with the same node IDs as in graph
od_matrix_long <- data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 3),
                             to = c(4, 4, 4), flow = c(100, 80, 60))

# Run traffic assignment (and route enumeration)
result <- run_assignment(graph, od_matrix_long, angle.max = NA)
#> Created graph with 4 nodes and 4 edges...
#> Computed distance matrix of dimensions 4 x 4 ...

# Access results
result$final_flows
#> [1] 100.00000  16.13649 196.13649  43.86351
```

### Working with Spatial Networks

``` r
library(flownet)
library(sf)

# Read network from shapefile and create undirected graph (optional)
graph <- st_read("data/network.shp") |> 
  linestrings_to_graph() |>
  create_undirected_graph()

# Read zone centroids and get nearest nodes
od_zones <- st_read("data/od_zones.shp") |> st_centroid()
nodes <- nodes_from_graph(graph, sf = TRUE)
nearest_nodes <- nodes$node[st_nearest_feature(od_zones, nodes)]

# Consolidate Graph (optional)
graph <- consolidate_graph(graph, keep = nearest_nodes, w = ~ cost)

# Simplify network by keeping only traversed edges along shortest paths (optional)
# Use 'by' for multimodal networks to compute paths separately per mode
graph <- simplify_network(graph, nearest_nodes, cost.column = "cost", by = ~ mode)
```

### Example Workflow

``` r
library(fastverse)
fastverse_extend(flownet, sf, mapview)

# 1. Load network and OD zone nodes
network <- st_read("data/network.shp")
od_zones <- st_read("data/od_zones.shp") |> st_centroid()
od_matrix <- fread("data/od_container_flows.csv") |> qM(1)
if(!all(dim(od_matrix) == nrow(od_zones))) stop("zones and OD matrix must match")

# 2. Convert network to graph
graph <- network |>
  linestrings_to_graph() |>
  create_undirected_graph()

# 3. Map zones to nearest network nodes
nodes <- nodes_from_graph(graph, sf = TRUE)
nearest_nodes <- nodes$node[st_nearest_feature(od_zones, nodes)]

# 4. Prepare OD matrix
od_matrix_long <- melt_od_matrix(od_matrix, nodes = nearest_nodes)

# 5. Run assignment
result <- run_assignment(graph, od_matrix_long, cost.column = "cost_column")

# 6. Visualize results (optional)
network$final_flows <- NA_real_
network$final_flows[attr(graph, "group.starts")] <- result$final_flows
mapview(network, zcol = "final_flows")
```

### Included Data

The package includes four example datasets for Africa:

- **`africa_network`**: A road transport network with 2,825 LINESTRING
  features representing existing roads (2,344 edges) and proposed new
  links (481 edges). Each edge includes attributes such as distance,
  travel duration, border crossing costs, terrain ruggedness, and road
  upgrade costs.

- **`africa_cities_ports`**: 453 African cities with population \>
  100,000 and international ports. Includes population data, capital
  status, and port cargo outflows.

- **`africa_segments`**: 14,358 raw network segments representing
  intersected road routes. Useful for demonstrating network
  consolidation and simplification functions.

- **`africa_trade`**: Bilateral trade flows between 47 African countries
  aggregated by HS section (21 product categories). Values represent
  annual averages over 2012-2022.

The `africa_network`, `africa_cities_ports`, and `africa_segments`
datasets are from Krantz, S. (2024). [Optimal Investments in Africa’s
Road Network](https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10893). Policy Research

## Main Functions

### Traffic Assignment and Route Enumeration

- **[`run_assignment()`](https://sebkrantz.github.io/flownet/reference/run_assignment.md)**:
  - Iterates through OD-pairs generating sensible alternative routes
  - Assigns traffic flows to network edges using path-sized logit model
  - Supports directed and undirected graphs
  - Returns flows and optional path/route information
  - **Key Parameters**:
    - **`beta`** (default: 1): Path-sized logit parameter (beta_PSL)
    - **`detour.max`** (default: 1.5): Maximum detour factor for
      alternative routes. Higher values consider more routes but
      increase computation time
    - **`angle.max`** (default: 90): Maximum detour angle in degrees
      (two-sided)
    - **`return.extra`**: Additional results to return from the route
      enumeration stage (`"paths"`, `"edges"`, `"counts"`, `"costs"`,
      `"weights"`)
