\title{Extract Nodes from Graph}
\usage{
nodes_from_graph(graph_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_df}{A data frame representing a graph with columns:
\code{from}, \code{to}, \code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with unique nodes and their coordinates:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{node} - Node ID
    \item \code{X} - Node X-coordinate (longitude)
    \item \code{Y} - Node Y-coordinate (latitude)
  }
  Nodes are sorted by node ID.
}
\description{
Extract unique nodes with their coordinates from a graph data frame.
}
\details{
This function extracts all unique nodes from both the \code{from} and \code{to}
columns of the graph, along with their corresponding coordinates. Duplicate nodes
are removed, keeping only unique node IDs with their coordinates.
}
