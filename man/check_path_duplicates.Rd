\usage{
check_path_duplicates(paths1, paths2, delta_ks)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths1}{List of integer vectors containing edge numbers for the first part of paths.}

\item{paths2}{List of integer vectors containing edge numbers for the second part of paths.}

\item{delta_ks}{Integer vector used as a hash table. Must be large enough to index all
edge numbers (i.e., length should be >= max edge number + 1).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of with the indices of paths for which no duplicates exist.
}
\description{
Check if combined paths (from paths1 and paths2) have duplicated edges.
}
\details{
For each path index k, this function combines \code{paths1[[k]]} and \code{paths2[[k]]}
into a single path and checks if any edge appears more than once. The function uses
\code{delta_ks} as a hash table that is cleared after checking each path.

The function requires that:
\itemize{
  \item \code{paths1} and \code{paths2} are lists of equal length
  \item Each element of \code{paths1} and \code{paths2} is an integer vector
  \item \code{delta_ks} is an integer vector with length >= max edge number + 1
}
}
