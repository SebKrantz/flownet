\arguments{
\item{graph_df}{A data frame representing a graph with columns:
\code{from} and \code{to} (node IDs), and optionally other columns to preserve.
If coordinate columns (\code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}) are present, they will be
preserved and updated based on the consolidated node coordinates.}

\item{directed}{Logical (default: FALSE). Whether the graph is directed.}

\item{drop.edges}{Character vector (default: \code{c("loop", "duplicate", "single")}). Types of edges to drop:
\code{"loop"} removes self-loops (edges where from == to),
\code{"duplicate"} removes duplicate edges (same from-to pair),
\code{"single"} removes edges leading to singleton nodes (nodes that occur only once).
Set to \code{NULL} to keep all edges.}

\item{contract}{Logical (default: TRUE). If TRUE, contracts the graph by removing
intermediate nodes (nodes that occur exactly twice) and merging connecting edges.
If FALSE, only drops edges as specified in \code{drop.edges}.}

\item{by}{Link characteristics to preserve/not contract across, passed as a one-sided formula or character vector of column names. Typically this includes attributes like \emph{mode}, \emph{type}, or \emph{capacity} to ensure that only edges with the same characteristics are contracted.}

\item{keep.nodes}{Numeric vector (optional). Node IDs to preserve during consolidation,
even if they occur exactly twice. Also used to preserve nodes when dropping singleton edges.}

\item{\dots}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[collapse]{collap}()} for aggregation across contracted edges. The defaults are \code{FUN = fmean} for numeric columns and \code{catFUN = fmode} for categorical columns. Select columns using \code{cols} or use argument \code{custom = list(fmean = cols1, fsum = cols2, fmode = cols3)} to map different columns to specific aggregation functions. It is highly recommended to weight the aggregation (using \code{w = ~ weight_col}) by the length/cost of the edges.}

\item{recursive}{One of \code{"none"/FALSE} (drop edges, contract, and aggregate once), \code{"partial"} (recursively drop edges and contract but only aggregate once), or \code{"full"/TRUE} (recursively drop edges, contract, and aggregate the graph
until no further consolidation is possible).}

\item{verbose}{Logical (default: TRUE). Whether to print messages about dropped edges
and consolidation progress.}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the consolidated graph with:
  \itemize{
    \item All columns from \code{graph_df} (aggregated if consolidation occurred),
      excluding \code{from}, \code{to}, and optionally \code{edge} and \code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}
      (which are re-added if present in original)
    \item \code{from}, \code{to}, \code{edge} - Node/edge IDs (updated after consolidation)
    \item Coordinate columns (\code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}) if present in original
    \item Attribute \code{"keep.edges"} - Indices of original edges that were kept (before aggregation)
    \item Attribute \code{"group.id"} - Integer mapping each kept edge to its row in the result (after aggregation)
  }
}
\description{
Consolidate a graph by contracting/removing intermediate nodes (nodes that occur exactly twice) and dropping loop, duplicate, and singleton edges (leading to dead ends). This simplifies the network topology while preserving connectivity.
}
\details{
This function consolidates/simplifies a graph by:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Dropping edges}: Optionally removes self-loops, duplicate edges, and edges
    leading to singleton nodes (nodes that appear only once in the graph)
  \item \strong{Contracting nodes}: Removes intermediate nodes (nodes that occur exactly twice)
    by merging the two edges connected through them into a single longer edge
  \item \strong{Aggregating attributes}: When edges are merged, attributes/columns are aggregated
    using \code{\link[collapse]{collap}()}. The default aggregation is mean for numeric columns and mode for categorical columns.
  \item \strong{Recursive consolidation}: If \code{recursive = TRUE}, the function continues
    consolidating until no more nodes can be dropped or contracted, ensuring complete consolidation
}

Consolidation is useful for simplifying network topology while preserving connectivity.
For example, if node B connects A->B and B->C, it will be removed and replaced with A->C.
With \code{recursive = TRUE}, long chains (A->B->C->D) are fully contracted to A->D in
a single call.

For undirected graphs, the algorithm also handles cases where a node appears twice
as either origin or destination (circular cases).

If coordinate columns (\code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}) are present in the input,
they are preserved and updated based on the consolidated node coordinates from the original graph.
