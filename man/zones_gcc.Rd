\title{Zone Locations for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Region}
\format{
A Simple feature collection (sf object) with 115 POINT features and 3 fields:
\describe{
  \item{no}{Numeric. Zone identifier (1 to 115), corresponding to the row and column
  indices in \code{\link{od_matrices_gcc}}.}
  \item{name}{Character. Place name or description of the zone (e.g., "Bahrain",
  "Basrah", "Central Asia").}
  \item{country}{Character. Country or region name where the zone is located
  (e.g., "Bahrain", "Iraq", "Africa", "Central Asia").}
  \item{geometry}{POINT. Spatial geometry in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system,
  representing the zone centroid coordinates.}
}
}
\source{
Internal dataset for transport modeling in the GCC region.
}
\usage{
data(zones_gcc)
}
\description{
A spatial dataset containing point locations and descriptions for the 115 zones
used in the origin-destination matrices for the GCC region. Each zone represents
a geographic location (city, region, or country) that serves as an origin or
destination in the transport network.
}
\details{
The zones correspond to the node structure used in \code{\link{od_matrices_gcc}} and
\code{\link{network_gcc}}. Zone numbers match the row and column names in the OD matrices,
allowing for spatial analysis and visualization of trade flows between zones.

The dataset covers the GCC region and surrounding areas, including zones in:
\itemize{
  \item GCC countries (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, etc.)
  \item Middle Eastern countries (Iraq, Turkey, etc.)
  \item Regional aggregations (Africa, Central Asia, Europe, etc.)
}
}
\examples{
library(sf)
head(zones_gcc)

# Get zone coordinates
st_coordinates(zones_gcc)

# Find zones in a specific country
zones_gcc[zones_gcc$country == "Iraq", ]
