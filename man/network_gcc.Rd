\description{
A spatial dataset providing a multimodal transport network for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region,
including existing and planned links with generalized cost estimates. The network combines link cost and time
with border-passing costs (bpc) and times, and transfer penalties (tp) at intermodal terminals.
}
\details{
The dataset represents a comprehensive multimodal transport network covering the GCC region and surrounding areas.
Links are classified by transport mode (Rail, HGV, Maritime, CONNECT) and include both existing infrastructure
and planned projects. Generalized costs are computed by combining:
\itemize{
  \item Link-level costs and times (tariff_cost, link_time)
  \item Border-passing costs and times (bpc_cost, bpc_time) for cross-border links
  \item Transfer penalties (tp_cost, tp_time) at intermodal terminals
}

The network spans a bounding box from approximately 17°N to 31°N latitude and 32°E to 56°E longitude,
covering the GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, etc.) as well as Turkey,
parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia.
