\description{
A spatial dataset representing a discretized road transport network connecting major African cities
and ports. The network combines existing road infrastructure (2,344 edges) with proposed new links
(481 edges) identified through network efficiency analysis. Each edge contains distance, travel time,
border crossing costs, terrain characteristics, and road upgrade cost estimates.
}
\details{
The network was constructed through the following process:
\enumerate{
  \item Computing optimal routes between all city pairs within 2,000km using OSRM
  \item Filtering routes using network efficiency criteria (alpha = 45 degrees, EU-grade efficiency)
  \item Intersecting and aggregating overlapping route segments
  \item Contracting the network to reduce complexity while preserving connectivity
  \item Identifying proposed new links that would improve network route efficiency
  \item Adding border crossing costs based on country pairs
  \item Computing terrain, population, and road cost attributes
}

The \code{gravity} and \code{gravity_rd} fields measure edge importance based on the population
gravity model: routes between larger, closer cities contribute more weight to edges they traverse.

The bounding box spans continental Africa from approximately 34S to 37N latitude
and 17W to 49E longitude.
