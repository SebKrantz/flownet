\arguments{
\item{graph_df}{A data.frame with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, and optionally a cost column.
Represents the network graph with edges between nodes.}

\item{od_matrix_long}{A data.frame with columns \code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{flow}.
Represents the origin-destination matrix in long format with flow values.}

\item{directed}{Logical (default: FALSE). Whether the graph is directed.}

\item{cost.column}{Character string (default: "cost") or numeric vector. Name of the cost column
in \code{graph_df}, or a numeric vector of edge costs with length equal to \code{nrow(graph_df)}.
The cost values are used to compute shortest paths and determine route probabilities.}

\item{method}{Character string (default: "PSL"). Assignment method:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"PSL"}: Path-Sized Logit model considering multiple routes with overlap correction
  \item \code{"AoN"}: All-or-Nothing assignment, assigns all flow to the shortest path (faster but no route alternatives)
}}

\item{beta}{Numeric (default: 1). Path-sized logit parameter (beta_PSL).}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}

\item{detour.max}{Numeric (default: 1.5). Maximum detour factor for alternative routes (applied to shortest paths cost). This is a key parameter controlling the execution time of the algorithm: considering more routes (higher \code{detour.max}) substantially increases computation time.}

\item{angle.max}{Numeric (default: 90). Maximum detour angle (in degrees, two sided). I.e., nodes not within this angle measured against a straight line from origin to destination node will not be considered for detours.}

\item{unique.cost}{Logical (default: TRUE). Deduplicates paths based on the total cost prior to generating them. Since multiple 'intermediate nodes' may be on the same path, there is likely a significant number of duplicate paths which this option removes.}

\item{npaths.max}{Integer (default: Inf). For method \code{"PSL"}: Maximum number of paths to compute per OD-pair. If the number of paths exceeds this number, a random sample will be taken from all but the shortest path. For method \code{"AoN"}: Maximum number of paths to compute at once.}

\item{return.extra}{Character vector specifying additional results to return. Options include:
\code{"graph"}, \code{"dmat"}, \code{"paths"}, \code{"edges"} (PSL only),
\code{"counts"}, \code{"costs"}, and \code{"weights"} (PSL only).
For AoN: \code{"costs"} returns a numeric vector of path costs, and \code{"counts"} returns a global integer vector of edge traversal counts.
Use \code{"all"} to return all available extra results for the selected method.}

\item{precompute.dmat}{Logical (default: TRUE). Should distance matrices be precomputed or computed on the fly.
The former is more memory intensive but dramatically speeds up the OD-iterations.}

\item{verbose}{Logical (default: TRUE). Show progress bar and intermediate steps completion status?}

\item{nthreads}{Integer (default: 1L). Number of threads (daemons) to use for parallel processing with \code{\link[mirai]{mirai}}. Should not exceed the number of logical processors.}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{flowr}, typically returned by \code{\link{run_assignment}}.}
}

\description{
Assign traffic flows to network edges using path-sized logit (PSL) model.
}
\details{
This function performs traffic assignment using one of two methods:

\strong{All-or-Nothing (AoN) Method:}
A simple assignment method that assigns all flow from each OD pair to the single shortest path.
This is much faster than PSL but does not consider route alternatives or overlaps.
Parameters \code{detour.max}, \code{angle.max}, \code{unique.cost}, \code{npaths.max},
\code{beta}, and \code{precompute.dmat} are ignored for AoN.

\strong{Path-Sized Logit (PSL) Method:}
A more sophisticated assignment method that considers multiple alternative routes:
\itemize{
  \item Creates a graph from \code{graph_df} using igraph, normalizing node IDs internally
  \item Computes shortest path distance matrix for all node pairs (if \code{precompute.dmat = TRUE})
  \item For each origin-destination pair in \code{od_matrix_long}:
    \itemize{
      \item Identifies alternative routes (detours) that are within \code{detour.max} of shortest path cost. This is done by considering all other nodes and adding the shortest paths costs from origin node to an intermediate node (any other node) and from intermediate node to destination node. If \code{angle.max} is specified, filters detours to those within the specified angle from origin to destination. This means we only consider intermediate nodes that are roughly 'in the direction' of the destination node, and also not further away in terms of geodesic distance. If also \code{unique.cost = TRUE}, duplicate paths are removed based on the total cost. Thus, using only the shortest-paths-cost matrix and a matrix of the geodesic distances of the nodes (if \code{is.finite(angle.max)}), the algorithm pre-selects unique paths that are plausible both in terms of detour factor (cost) and direction before actually computing them. This speeds up route enumeration and PSL computations considerably.
      \item Finds shortest paths from origin to intermediate nodes and from intermediate nodes to destination
      \item Filters paths to remove those with duplicate edges, i.e., where the intermediate node is approached and departed from via the same edge(s).
      \item Computes path-sized logit probabilities accounting for route overlap
      \item Assigns flows to edges based on probabilities weighted by route overlap
    }
  \item Returns results including final flows and optionally additional information
}

The path-sized logit model accounts for route overlap by adjusting probabilities based on
the number of alternative routes using each edge. Flows are assigned proportionally to
the computed probabilities. The model uses the parameter \code{beta} to control the
sensitivity to route overlap.

When \code{angle.max} is specified and \code{graph_df} contains coordinate columns
(\code{FX}, \code{FY}, \code{TX}, \code{TY}), the function uses geographic distance
calculations to restrict detours to those within the specified angle, improving
computational efficiency and route realism.
